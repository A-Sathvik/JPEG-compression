# Requirements

## Introduction
* Knowing the units of measurement that correspond with a number can give you so much more information than a digit as a standalone. 

* In a nutshell, the unit of measurement in science and math serves as the supporting pillar upon which a number rests.

* **Unit conversion** is a process that involves multiplication or division by a numerical factor.

* With the global flow of information that occurs these days, it is very important for everyone to learn these most basic conversion factors.

* Keeping in mind all the conversion and inter-conversion processes may not be easy for everyone.

* A metric conversion calculator is a tool that renders a helping hand by doing metric conversions in few seconds.

## Research
* During the French Revolution, the then existing measurement system was so impractical for trade and scientific purposes. 

* So, it set the stage for the emergence of a system of measurement with rationally related units and simple rules for combining them.

* Thus, a decimal based conversion system, called the Metric System,  was introduced and it was widely accepted by scientists of those days for being a rational system.

* The metric system was devised with a aim “for all people, for all time.”

* Today, the official system of measurement in most of the countries across the world is the metric system also known as the “International System of Units.

* Though a standard system, there are many units within the metric systems and inter-conversion is tedious because one has to remember all the conversion factors.

* Hence a tool that makes all these conversion immediately available will be a welcoming choice.
