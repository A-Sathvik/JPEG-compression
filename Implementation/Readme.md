`tb.v` is the testbench module.
`DCT_2D` module requires multipliers of different sizes for discrete cosine transform and quantisation steps.
`Size_and_code` provides the suffix code, `Huffman_encoding` provides the prefix code.
{Prefix code, Suffix code} of every resultant term of run-length encoding is the required output.
